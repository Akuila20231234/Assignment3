#DRY principle main function is to avoid any repeating code so you won't repeat yourself
#Here we have a code that contain the values of a shape, a rectangle
width=10
length=5
area=length*width #To find the area of a recatangle we must use this formula: length multiply by the width
print(area) #Print to calculate the area of that rectangle

#In this simpler code it does the same thing as the one on top but with a more sleek and straightforward approach without repeating the same sequence over and over
def calculate_area(length,width): #A single line of code that has all the attributes
    return length *width
    #Call the function and you have the results present
