#Seperation of concerns principle is used to divide a system into independent parts to focus on one thing at a time
#original code: 
import turtle #Use the syntax to draw your shape
s=turtle.Turtle()
s.forward(100) #This line of code is to direct the line to move forward
s.right(90) #Likewise this code is to move the line to where you want, in this case move right
s.forward(100) #Repeat the process in order to get the shpae you want
s.right(90)
s.forward(100)
s.right(90)
s.forward(100)
turtle.exitonclick() #Call it to draw the shape of your choosing

#altered code: in this code it breaks down everything in a more professional manner and it gives you a clear picture of what each function does
